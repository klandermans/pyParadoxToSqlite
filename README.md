# pyParadoxToSqlite

Applied XLIB to convert microsoft foxpro databases to sqlite. The script scans a directory, checks whether the file can be read, as soon as there are records in the table, the script adds them to the SQLITE database. The abstract of the script comes from a German repository, my remarks are also in Dutch.
